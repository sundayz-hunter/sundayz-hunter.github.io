<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sundayz</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Ethical Hacker and Python Developer from France !</h3>


## About Me
I have always been passionate about computer science and began my journey in the financial markets, creating trading tools and algorithms. This led me to discover my love for development, particularly in **Python**, and later, my deep interest in **cybersecurity**.

Today, I combine my skills in **development**, **system administration**, and **security** to build, optimize, and secure web applications and APIs.

I actively participate in bug bounty programs on platforms like YesWeHack, where I uncover vulnerabilities to help secure applications and systems.

I recommend [HackTheBox Academy](https://referral.hackthebox.com/mzw44UJ) to anyone looking to dive into the world of cybersecurity !
